# Internal Feedback

Let your agents give feedback on how they like using Zendesk.

This app will help you get a sense of how your agents like using Zendesk by allowing them to provide feedback via an app on the sidebar.  Once the feedback is submitted, a ticket is created with feedback sent from the agent and can be tagged and routed to the appropriate person or team.
